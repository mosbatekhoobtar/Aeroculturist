      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p class="section-text">
        Urbanization and the growing demand for sustainable food production solutions necessitate innovative approaches to agriculture. Vertical hydroponics offers a viable way to grow crops in limited spaces while conserving resources like water and energy. This research proposes the development of a Smart Vertical Hydroponics System (SVHS) that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time monitoring and care optimization, QR code technology for easy plant data access, and sustainable development principles for efficient resource management.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        The SVHS will allow users to grow essential crops such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and potatoes in urban settings. By utilizing AI for personalized plant care and creating an engaging user experience through QR code integration, this system aims to increase crop yields, minimize resource consumption, and promote sustainable home farming.
      </p>

      <!-- Objectives -->
      <h3>2. Objectives</h3>
      <ul class="research-progress-list">
        <li>Develop a Smart Vertical Hydroponics System for urban homes to grow essential crops like cucumbers, tomatoes, and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Integrate AI for real-time monitoring and optimization of plant care, adjusting water, light, and nutrient delivery based on sensor data.</li>
        <li>Enhance user-plant interaction by assigning each plant a personality and allowing them to "communicate" their needs through a mobile or desktop app.</li>
        <li>Implement QR code technology for easy access to real-time plant data and care recommendations.</li>
        <li>Minimize water and resource usage to align with sustainable development goals, using a water-recycling system and energy-efficient LED lighting.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Literature Review -->
      <h3>3. Literature Review</h3>
      <p class="section-text">
        Vertical hydroponics systems are known for their ability to grow plants in limited spaces without soil, reducing water consumption by up to 90% compared to traditional agriculture (Jones & Patel, 2021). Existing research shows that integrating AI into hydroponic systems can optimize resource use and increase crop yields by automatically adjusting conditions like water and nutrient levels based on real-time sensor data (Brown, 2019). However, there is a gap in the literature on combining AI, QR codes, and personalized human-plant interaction to create a fully automated and user-friendly home farming solution.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        This proposal builds on existing research by introducing innovative features such as assigning plants personalities and integrating real-time communication with users through mobile and desktop applications. This approach aims to make home-based farming more accessible and engaging, especially in urban environments where space is limited.
      </p>

      <!-- Methodology -->
      <h3>4. Methodology</h3>
      <h4>4.1 System Design</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        The hydroponic structure will be a multi-layered vertical system designed to fit in urban spaces such as balconies or small rooms. Sensors for temperature, humidity, pH, light, and nutrient levels will be integrated into the system. The crops will grow in nutrient-enriched water, with minimal soil, maximizing space and efficiency.
      </p>

      <h4>4.2 AI Integration</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        The AI component will monitor sensor data in real-time, adjusting the environment for optimal plant growth. The AI will control irrigation, lighting, and nutrient levels automatically, ensuring each plant receives personalized care. A machine learning model will allow plants to communicate their health and needs to users through a mobile/desktop app, providing tailored care recommendations.
      </p>

      <h4>4.3 QR Code Technology</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        Each plant will have a unique QR code that users can scan to access real-time data about the plant's growth stage, nutrient needs, and environmental conditions. This system will make plant management easy and intuitive, linking users directly to the AI's recommendations.
      </p>

      <h4>4.4 Sustainable Development Focus</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        The system will include a water-recycling mechanism to minimize water consumption. Energy-efficient LED lighting will be used to optimize energy use while promoting plant growth. These sustainability features align with the principles of sustainable development, ensuring minimal resource usage while maximizing productivity.
      </p>
